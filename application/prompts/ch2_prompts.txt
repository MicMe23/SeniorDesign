generate engineering problems for Chapter 2: Forces and Other Vectors.

Matrix meaning:
- Columns: force1, force2, force3, ... , forcen
- Rows in top to bottom order: magnitude, angle_deg, x_direction, y_direction
- Angle is degrees counter clockwise from positive x axis.

Rules:
- Use the selected domain (aerospace / biomedical / civil) for the story context.
- Each column is a vector. Do not assume equilibrium unless explicitly stated.
- Some entries may be variables (e.g., F1, theta2, F3x). Treat those as unknowns for the student.
- Do NOT reveal the numeric value of any unknown anywhere in the problem text.
- Only use Chapter 2 concepts: magnitude, direction, components, vector addition.
- Do NOT provide a solution.

Output:
Return ONLY the final problem text (title + scenario + given data + 3–5 student questions).
No JSON. No markdown code fences.
