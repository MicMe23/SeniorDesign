# Project Plan

1. Obtain sample data from professors.  JP
2. Create more sample data based off of provided examples. JP 
3. Label data accordingly and sort into folders.  JP
4. Validate data is accurate and sorted into correct categories with professors.  JP
5. Research best approach for the model. Should we use RAG or something else?  JP
6. Document required dependencies for programming.  Michael
7. Research leveraging AWS with our student benefits.  Michael
8. Design basic UI for testing model.  Michael
9. **Phase 1:** Develop model that can at least generate sample problems.  Michael
   - They don’t have to be correct or perfect just yet, but it’s a solid milestone if we can consistently generate on-topic questions.  
10. Test the model thoroughly. Meet with professors and validate generated questions.  Chris
11. Gather even more data to make the model more accurate and tune it towards preferences.  Chris
12. Document any flaws or preferences from professors.  Chris 
13. **Phase 2:** Improve the model based on suggestions and optimize question generation.  Chris
14. Test and validate thoroughly once again.  Chris
15. Possibly implement guided solution.  Chris
